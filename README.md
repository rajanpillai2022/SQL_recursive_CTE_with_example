# SQL_recursive_CTE_with_example
Use of Recursive CTE for solve complex sql problems.
CTE stands for "Common Table Expression," and it's a temporary result set that you can reference within the context of a SQL query. CTEs are often used to simplify complex queries, break down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts, and improve the readability and maintainability of SQL code.

A CTE is defined using the `WITH` keyword and consists of a name for the CTE and a SELECT statement that defines the data to be included in the CTE. The CTE can then be referenced in subsequent parts of the query, just like a regular table or subquery.

Here's a basic syntax for creating and using a CTE:

```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...) AS (
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM source_table
    WHERE conditions
)
SELECT *
FROM cte_name
WHERE additional_conditions;
```

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept. Suppose you have a database with a table named `Orders` and you want to find the total sales amount for each customer:

```sql
WITH CustomerSales AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM
        Orders
    GROUP BY
        customer_id
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    total_sales
FROM
    CustomerSales
ORDER BY
    total_sales DESC;
```

In this example, the `CustomerSales` CTE calculates the total sales amount for each customer using the `SUM` function and grouping by `customer_id`. Then, the main query selects and displays the results from the CTE.

CTEs can also be used for recursive queries, where a query refers to its own output, making them useful for working with hierarchical data structures like organizational charts, file systems, etc.

Remember that CTEs are temporary and exist only for the duration of the query that references them. They are particularly helpful for making complex queries more modular, enhancing readability, and reducing redundancy in SQL code.
